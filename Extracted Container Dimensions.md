## Extracted Container Dimensions

Based on the technical drawing, this is a **1.5 mL centrifuge tube** with the following internal dimensions:

**Cylindrical Section:**

- Inner diameter: **10.46 mm** (φ10.46)
- Height: **39.5 mm**
- Wall thickness: **0.82 mm**

**Conical Bottom Section:**

- Height: **18.4 mm**
- Wall thickness: **0.93 mm**
- Tapers from the cylindrical diameter to a rounded bottom

**Top Cap/Opening:**

- Various stepped diameters: φ12.78, φ10.86, φ10.33
- Center opening: φ9.59
- Total cap height: approximately 8.77 mm


## Volume-Height Data Simulation

I've generated **75 data pairs** showing the liquid column height for volumes from **0.02 mL to 1.50 mL** in 0.02 mL increments. The calculation accounts for the conical bottom section (where volume increases non-linearly with height) and the cylindrical section above it.

**Key findings:**

- At 0.02 mL: liquid height = 6.183 mm (within conical section)
- At 1.50 mL: liquid height = 29.722 mm (extends into cylindrical section)
- Transition from cone to cylinder occurs at approximately 0.18 mL and 18.4 mm height


## Download CSV File

The CSV file contains two columns:

- **Volume_mL**: Accumulated volume in milliliters
- **Height_mm**: Corresponding liquid column height from the bottom in millimeters

# where is the csv file

The CSV file is available for download above. You can download it by clicking the download button next to the file reference labeled **** in my previous response.

The file is named **centrifuge_tube_volume_height.csv** and contains 75 rows of data with the volume-height pairs for the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, spanning from 0.02 mL to 1.50 mL in 0.02 mL increments.

If you're having trouble locating the download button, it should appear as a clickable element associated with the file reference in your interface.

# change the column order

Done! The CSV file columns have been reordered. The new column order is now:

**Height_mm | Volume_mL**

The updated file is ready for download:
